/**
 struct representing a fraction
 
 Properties
 - numerator (Int): Thge top number
 - denominator (Int): The bottom number
 - description (String): description
 - unicode (String): the unicode representation of the fraction. Used for display purposes only
 - adder (int): Should have the value of 1, when rounding up to the next number. Otherwise it is zero
 
 Computed Variables
 - value (Double): The quotient of the numerator and denominator. Used for all comparisons.
 - displayAs (String): Representation by putting a forward slash between the numerator and denominator
 
 Protocols:
 - CustomStringConvertible: has a description
 - Equatable (==): Based on the comparison of each fraction's value
 - Comparable (<): Based on the comparison of each fraction's value
